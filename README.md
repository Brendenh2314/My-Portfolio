# ALN2 TASK 1: WEB-BASED SPRINT INVENTORY APPLICATION

## Introduction

Welcome to my "ALN2 TASK 1: WEB-BASED SPRINT INVENTORY APPLICATION" project! This project showcases my ability to customize and maintain web-based inventory management software using Java frameworks.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have customized a Spring Framework application with an HTML front-end and a Java back-end to create a web-based sprint inventory application. The application's purpose is to help businesses efficiently manage their inventory.

## Key Highlights

- **Customized User Interface**: I've tailored the user interface to meet the unique needs of a fictional customer, for a simple and intuitive user experience.

- **About Page**: I've added an "About" page that provides valuable insights into the customer's company, enhancing user engagement and understanding.

- **Sample Inventory**: I've created a sample inventory to demonstrate the application's functionality. It includes:
    - Five distinct products.
    - Corresponding component parts.
    This sample inventory serves as a practical illustration of the system's capabilities.

- **"Buy Now" Functionality**: I've added a "Buy Now" button that allows users to make purchases directly from the product list, providing convenience and improving user satisfaction.

- **Inventory Tracking**: The application tracks maximum and minimum inventory levels for efficient inventory management.

- **Validation and Testing**: Validation checks and unit tests have been implemented to guarantee data accuracy and system reliability.

## Project Significance

This project reflects my expertise in software design and development, particularly in the realm of Java frameworks. It highlights my ability to tailor software solutions to meet specific business requirements and deliver an outstanding user experience.
